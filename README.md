# Task 2 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
Problem - 
To predict the percentage scores of a student based on his/her hours of study.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs in a day?

# Task 3 - To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

Problem - 
To predict the optimum number of clusters from the given ‘Iris’ dataset and represent it visually 
Here, I have used the K-Means Algorithm

# Task 4 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we will create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
Problem - 
To predict the right class of Iris for any new data.
